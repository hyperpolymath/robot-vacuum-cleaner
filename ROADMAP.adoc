== Overview

Development roadmap for the robot vacuum cleaner simulation system with dual Julia/Rust implementations.

== v1.0 - Production Release (Current)

**Target:** 2026-02
**Status:** Active development

=== Core Features
* ✅ Autonomous navigation (A*, spiral, zigzag, wall-follow, random)
* ✅ SLAM implementation with particle filter
* ✅ Sensor simulation (obstacle, cliff, bumper)
* ✅ Battery management and charging dock
* ✅ Multiple cleaning modes
* ✅ Real-time matplotlib visualization
* ✅ Dual implementation (Julia + Rust)
* ✅ GraphQL API

=== Quality & Testing
* ✅ CI/CD pipeline
* ✅ Code coverage tracking
* ✅ Comprehensive test suite

=== Remaining for v1.0
* [ ] ROADMAP.adoc (this file)
* [ ] PLAYBOOK.scm, AGENTIC.scm, NEUROSYM.scm
* [ ] .tool-versions
* [ ] Final performance optimization
