# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Emotional Safety Commitment

In addition to standard community guidelines, this project is committed to
**emotional safety** for all participants. We recognize that:

- **Contribution anxiety is real**: Not everyone feels confident contributing
- **Reversibility reduces stress**: Knowing changes can be undone reduces pressure
- **Attribution matters**: Recognition is a form of emotional compensation
- **Withdrawal is acceptable**: Contributors can step away without judgment
- **Experimentation is encouraged**: It's safe to try new approaches

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with new contributors and questions
* Assuming good intent in interactions
* Supporting contributors' emotional well-being
* Respecting requests to withdraw contributions
* Celebrating successes and learning from failures together

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Dismissing or attacking requests for emotional safety accommodations
* Pressuring contributors to maintain contributions after withdrawal request
* Removing attribution or credit from contributions
* Malicious code modifications intended to harm users or the project
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

reporter of any incident.

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

ban.

sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or

with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
